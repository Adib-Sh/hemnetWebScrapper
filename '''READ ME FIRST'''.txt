Due to the complication of the codes and the different purposes of each part, I divided each part of the code into different python files. 
To run the files from the beginning please follow this order:
1- hemnet_bs4_prcs_salda.py
2- hemnet_bs4_datamng.py
3- hemnet_bs4_mdmodel.py

***
It may take a considerable time to store the data from the beginning so the stored data are provided in JSON files and for testing, you may want
to only run the last python file. 
***

***
For testing you may want to use these samples (data is in Swedish language):
input:'Please enter your desired kommun:'
samples: Stockholm, Huddinge, Karlstad, Eskilstuna, Sala
input: 'Please enter your desired housig type:'
samples: LÃ¤genheter, Tomter, Radhus
input:'Please enter the number of rooms:'
sample: choose a integer (between 1 to 6 is desirable)
input:'Please enter your desired housig type:'
sample: choose a number (between 30 to 500 is desirable)


NOTICE
As you may notice, the model is working but the result has very low accuracy!
This may be resolved by normalizing the data or using the more complex model.
